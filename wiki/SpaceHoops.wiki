#summary An overview of how the game will work.

= Introduction =

Space hoops will be a fun space game where the goal is to fly your spaceship through large hoops in as quick a time as possible. There will be varying levels of difficulty.

The first menu screen will allow you to choose the level you wish to play (1-10?). This screen will also show you the key bindings (up, down, accelerate etc). On start, you will then be presented with the "main" game loop.

Once you cross the "start" hoop, the timer will start and be displayed on the screen (via a basic HUD). A very simple interactive guidance tool will show you where the current and next hoop is located. Once you have finished, your time will be displayed. After (say) 10 seconds, you'll be returned to the main menu.

So you'll notice this is a very basic setup. No fancy menus to control screen resolution. No pause. Basically, it comes down to time (resource) constraints. Once I'm happy that I could give a working copy out there, I will try and think about tarting up (polishing the turd!).
